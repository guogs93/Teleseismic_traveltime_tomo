Code Author: Gaoshan Guo

Affiliation: Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGGCAS)

This code was developed during Gaoshan Guo's Master's study at IGGCAS under the supervision of Haiqiang Lan.

The forward modeling is based on an eikonal solver.

The gradient computation is based on the adjoint-state technique.

The inverse problem is solved within the framework of the open-source SEISCOPE OPTIMIZATION TOOLBOX (benefiting from the PhD study of Gaoshan Guo at GEOAZUR).
